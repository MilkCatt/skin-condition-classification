The disease classification model using SVM and other machine learning techniques can greatly enhance healthcare by enabling fast, accurate detection of conditions like Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, and Normal skin states. This can be applied in:

Hospitals/Clinics: Automating diagnosis, helping doctors make quicker, more precise decisions.
Telemedicine: Supporting remote consultations by classifying skin conditions based on images.
Public Health: Assisting in rapid screening during outbreaks for faster containment.
This model offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for improving healthcare diagnostics.

In addition to Monkeypox, Chickenpox, and Measles, the SVM and machine learning model could also be used to classify and detect other diseases with visual symptoms, such as:

Psoriasis: A chronic skin condition causing red, scaly patches.
Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis): Inflammatory skin condition with red, itchy rashes.
Rosacea: A common skin condition causing facial redness and swelling.
Shingles: A reactivation of the chickenpox virus, causing painful rashes.
Skin Cancer (e.g., Melanoma): Early detection of abnormal skin growths.
This technology can expand to support accurate diagnosis in a wide range of skin-related diseases, improving healthcare outcomes.
